# sort-by-position-photoshop
Sort layers in layer panel by it's Y position on the screen, simply select the items you want to sort and apply the script.

doesn't work with masked layers, as it takes the full image masked using it's Y position, not the clipping box.

Only works for the top layers/layersets of the document for now.
